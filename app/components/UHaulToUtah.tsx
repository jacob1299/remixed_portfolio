        Just two months ago, my wife and I decided to do just that. That's
        right, we rented a 26-foot truck, and hauled it across the country...
        all in the name of an RTO mandate. Implemented by myself. Yep, that's
        right. I chose to do this. Now that I've (hopefully) got your attention,
        I'd like to explore some observations I have made during the past 2+
        years of working in a post-Covid world. My career has not been long
        lived, considering I am only two years post undergrad, yet, I have seen
        some of the starkest changes to modern work culture in the post WWII
        era.

        Working from Home
      </h2>
      <p className=" mb-4">
        My journey began in November of 2021, right before graduation. I
        accepted an offer with a fantastic company (shoutout RainFocus), and
        immediately began working from an apartment I was renting with a friend
        of mine... one week before moving out. I still recall doing the company
        trainings while sitting on a shaky, backless, weightlifting bench. At
        the time, remote work provided the flexibility that I otherwise would
        not have had. Namely, I was able to get married, stay in a college town
        so that my wife could finish her master's degree, learn to work
        independently, etc... It was great. Over the next two years I would move
        two more times (another huge perk of remote work); but so would my
        friends. You see, being remote did lead to an isolation of sorts, which,
        for my personality, was not conducive to long term growth. Now, I did
        manage, but only through constant and continuous effort to have some
        sort of human interaction (thank you pickleball). I am only using myself
        as a prototype here, to show that remote work is not for everyone. This
        is by no means a plea to RTO. In fact, I would strongly oppose such a
        measure.

        Working in the Office
      </h2>
      <p className=" mb-4">
        Over the past two months of going into the office, I have made a few
        observations. For one, I have noticed that I have begun to understand
        the company better than I had in the past. I've also been able to foster
        relationships with people in ways that I couldn't with the trailer park
        cats (yes, I lived in a trailer). Lastly, I have been able to catch on
        to company values, opinions, and "tribal knowledge" easier than I had
        been able to while working from home. While these certainly are good and
        even desirable qualities that could attract people to the office, it is
        important to realize that these things are not valuable to everyone. For
        some, the most valuable thing you could offer them is to be able to work
        from home, have a flexible schedule, and have the freedom to take their
        kids to school in the mornings before they have to be at work at 8am so
        that their seat doesn't get cold.

        Can remote work work for you?
      </h2>
      <p className=" mb-4">
        If remote work is to work, it must do so on an individual level. This
        article is not to discuss the merits of a militant in person mandate, or
        the merits of a remote-first company, but rather to think critically
        about which style suits you best. Regarding remote work, some of the
        most common reasons that RTO policies are put into practice are as
        follows: 1. management (haha I am funny). In all seriousness, the top
        two reasons that management may institute such measures often consist of
        the following beliefs:

          <p className=" mb-4">
            <strong>People work better in person</strong>: This is not true, for
            a plethora of reasons. A couple viable examples here are ADHD,
            complicated dynamics in the office, introvert tendencies,
            distracting office environments,
            <strong>
              someone having been hired under the expectation that they would
              work remote
            </strong>
            , etc... just to name a few. In fact, the last reason is actually
            more of an anti-reason. If someone is hired under the expectation
            that they will be working remotely, and then you force them to come
            into the office, this will probably affect their performance
            negatively. This is what is meant by "silent firing". This one also
            leaves a sour taste in my mind because in many cases it is a cover
            up for "<em>we don't trust our employees</em>". At RainFocus, we
            pride ourselves on being excellent stewards, and are not
            micro-managed. Sure, people may do peopley things, but at the end of
            the day, you can tell if someone is getting things done or not. And
            if you can't, then is there really an issue? Or maybe someone at
            your company needs to put the training wheels back on their bike and
            figure out why they can't tell if their employees are being good
            stewards. In most cases, your employee's success is in part a result
            of <strong>your</strong> leadership.

            <strong>Company culture</strong>: This one, in my opinion, is the
            strongest argument for in office work. When I worked remotely, I had
            to do some deep digging to feel relevant at the company, and try
            extra hard to "put myself out there". As my experience as a remote
            employee grew, this one became the main driver behind my qualms with
            my personal remote work journey. It became increasingly evident that
            in order for remote workers to feel included, the treatment for
            remote workers and in person workers needs to be roughly the same.
            However, the most important thing that MUST be equal for remote vs
            in person employees is communication. Without good collaboration
            tools and communication skills, especially for someone early in
            their career, it is very difficult to progress and be productive.

        With these things being said, can remote work work for you? My opinion
        is that remote work is here to stay... ish. I believe that some
        companies will continue to foster environments where remote work can
        thrive, while other companies will fall by the wayside by requiring
        people to return to office. Don't get me wrong, there are some cases
        where a company was in-person pre-covid, and was forced to pivot.
        However, in companies where they require an RTO policy, the leadership
        should be the first people back! As time goes on, the dust will likely
        settle on this Covid-induced fiasco. So, take heart! Do some
        introspecting on your personal communication skills, especially if you
        work from home. Make sure to put yourself out there, communicate
        effectively and efficiently, and check in on your fellow remote
        coworkers from time to time. You will be glad you did.
